            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <div class="about-content">
                <p>The Daily Grind started with a simple passion: to create a community hub where everyone feels welcome and can enjoy exceptional coffee. Founded in 2020 by dedicated coffee enthusiasts, we set out to source the finest beans globally and master the art of brewing. Our journey began in a small corner shop, driven by the belief that a good cup of coffee can truly make a difference in someone's day.</p>
                <p>Over the years, we've grown, but our core values remain the same: quality, community, and sustainability. We work directly with farmers to ensure fair trade practices and support sustainable agriculture. Every cup poured and every pastry baked is a testament to our commitment to excellence and our love for what we do.</p>
